Research
======
I am enthusiastic about scientific research and literally enjoy the process of acquiring knowledge, even if it could be painstaking sometimes. I have mastered relatively strong basic academic skills and still looking forward to enhancing their depth and breadth. I'm sincerely anticipating your guidance. I'm also glad to form cohesive collaborations with peers who have similar fields of interest.
